If you’re curious like me, you would often wonder how things work under the hood. I use my spare time to research how things work and i would like to share this bit with y’all.

So you enter “website.com” in your address bar and click enter. what happens in the split second before the page finally shows up?. A complex series of actions are being taken involving multiple package exchanges and protocols. Lets break down this process.

### The Address Detective (DNS Lookup)

Domain Name System (DNS) is basically a large library that for accessing domains and returning back the IP of the server that has the website the client (Your browser) is requesting.

```jsx
// DNS Query (Your Browser): www.website.com ->
// DNS found an IP for this address: 192.0.1.12 <- SENDS RESPONSE
```

### The Three Way Handshake (TCP Connection)

Once the IP address has been found, your browser would initiate a TCP (Transmission control protocol) connection. Here the browser communicates with the server to multiple times establish a connection and know that each service is ready to communicate.

- **SYN (Synchronise)**: Your browser sends a SYN packet to the server. This will be the starting point for data transmission
- **SYN-ACK (Synchronise-acknowledge):** The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet to the client. This acknowledges the client’s SYN packet.
- **ACK (Acknowledge):** The client sends a ACK again to the server to acknowledge this server’s SYN-ACK packet.

```jsx
// Your Browser: SYN ->
// Server: SYN-ACK <-
// Your Browser: ACK ->
```

At this point, the TCP connection has been established.

### Asking for the webpage (HTTP Request)

Once the TCP connection has been established, The browser sends a HTTP (or HTTPS) request packet to the server.

This packet would include a couple of things:

- The HTTP Method (GET request to the server)
- The requested resource (is usually a ./index.html file)
- HTTP headers (Host, User-Agent, Authorisation)

```jsx
// Your Browser: HTTP/HTTPS GET ./resource ->
//Server HTTP 200 & ./resource <-
```

### Delivering The Webpage (Server Response)

The server processes the client’s request and sends back a HTTP (or HTTPS) response packet to the client.

This packet would also include a couple of things:

- The HTTP status code (200 - Success, 401 - Unauthorised, 500 - Server Error)
- The requested resource(s) (HTML, CSS, Javascript files)
- HTTP headers (Content-Type, Set-Cookie, Expires, Connection)

```jsx
// HTML: Structure of the page
// CSS: styling
// Javascript: Interactions
// Other Assets: Images, icons, videos.. etc
```

At this stage, your browser takes over the ship and starts processing the files it has received. it renders the webpage and runs included assets including images, scripts and styles. Now you (the user) can interact with the website.

### The Four Way Handshake (Closing the TCP connection)

For most sites, websites don’t need to keep a connection with the server so the browser may close the TCP connection. This involves communicating with the server once again by sending packets.

There are 4 packets sent back and forth to close the connection:

- **FIN:** Your browser sends a finish (FIN) packet to the server.
- **ACK**: The server sends back a ACK packet to acknowledge this.

- **FIN:** The server then sends its own FIN packet to the browser.
- **ACK**: The browser sends back a ACK packet to acknowledge this.

```jsx
// Your Browser: FIN ->
// Server: ACK <-
// Server: FIN ->
// Your Browser: ACK ->
```

This series of packet exchange ensure a reliable connection between the client and server which results in seamless loading and delivery of websites. The entire process takes a fraction of a second, showcasing the efficiency of modern web technology.
