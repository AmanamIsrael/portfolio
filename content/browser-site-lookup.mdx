If you’re curious like me, you would often wonder how things work under the hood. You enter “website.com” in your address bar and click enter. what happens in the split second before the page finally shows up?. A complex series of actions are being taken involving multiple package exchanges and protocols. Lets break down this process.

### The Address Detective (DNS Lookup)

Domain Name System (DNS) is basically a large library of domains. when a domain is entered, it returns the IP address of the server that has the website the client (Your browser) is requesting.

```jsx
// Your Browser makes a DNS Query: www.website.com ->
// DNS found an IP for this address: 192.0.1.12 <- SENDS RESPONSE
```

### The Three Way Handshake (TCP Connection)

Once the IP address has been found, your browser initiates a TCP (Transmission control protocol) connection. Your browser then communicates with the server multiple times to establish a connection that both are ready to communicate.

- **SYN (Synchronise)**: Your browser sends a SYN packet to the server. This will be the starting point for data transmission
- **SYN-ACK (Synchronise-acknowledge):** The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet to your browser. This acknowledges the browser's SYN packet.
- **ACK (Acknowledge):** Your browser sends a ACK packet to the server to acknowledge this server’s SYN-ACK packet.

```jsx
// Your Browser: SYN ->
// Server: SYN-ACK <-
// Your Browser: ACK ->
```

At this point, the TCP connection has been established.

### Asking for the webpage (HTTP Request)

Once the TCP connection has been established, Your browser sends a HTTP (or HTTPS) request packet to the server.

This packet would include a couple of things:

- The HTTP Method (GET request to the server)
- The requested resource (is usually a ./index.html file)
- HTTP headers (Host, User-Agent, Authorization)

```jsx
// Your Browser: HTTP/HTTPS GET ./resource ->
//Server HTTP 200 & ./resource <-
```

### Delivering The Webpage (Server Response)

The server processes your browser’s request and sends back a HTTP (or HTTPS) response packet.

This packet would also include a couple of things:

- The HTTP status code (200 - Success, 401 - Unauthorized, 500 - Server Error)
- The requested resource(s) (HTML, CSS, Javascript files)
- HTTP headers (Content-Type, Set-Cookie, Expires, Connection)

```jsx
// HTML: Structure of the page
// CSS: styling
// Javascript: Interactions
// Other Assets: Images, icons, videos.. etc
```

At this stage, your browser takes the wheel and starts processing the files it has received. It renders the webpage and runs included assets like images, scripts and styles. Now you (the user) can interact with the website.

### The Four-Way Handshake (Closing the TCP connection)

For most websites, there's no need to maintain a persistent connection with the server so your browser may close the TCP connection. This involves a specific sequence of packet exchanges with the server.

There are 4 packets sent back and forth to close the connection:

- **FIN:** Your browser sends a finish (FIN) packet to the server.
- **ACK**: The server sends back a ACK packet to acknowledge this.

- **FIN:** The server then sends its own FIN packet to your browser.
- **ACK**: Your browser sends back a ACK packet to acknowledge this.

```jsx
// Your Browser: FIN ->
// Server: ACK <-
// Server: FIN ->
// Your Browser: ACK ->
```

This series of packet exchange ensure a reliable connection between the browser and server which results in seamless loading and delivery of websites. The entire process takes a fraction of a second, showcasing the efficiency of modern web technology.
